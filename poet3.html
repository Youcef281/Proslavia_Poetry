        <p>
        In a land far away, right now and back then,
        Where resolute millions,
        Fight to be free,
        The Palestinian sun will shine again,
        From desert to mountain,
        From river to sea.<br><br>

        No settler, no murder, no cowardly thief,
        Stuck to their chiefdom,
        In all certainty,
        Know the inspired native's strong belief,
        In peace and in freedom,
        In true liberty.<br><br>

        For 80 years, the struggle went on,
        Martyr for martyr,
        Man for man,
        They never left each other alone,
        Fighter for fighter,
        The fray began.<br><br>

        No 'Merican soldiers, no murders of kids,
        No British soldiers,
        No orange men,
        Could cross Palestine without a miss,
        Its Judaean boulders,
        Or Gaza's defense.<br><br>

        The world may be watching or cover its eyes,
        At war and at poverty,
        At genocide,
        But the struggle of Palestine never dies!
        For freedom and liberty,
        Which shall abide.<br><br>

        In a land far away, right now and back then,
        Where resolute millions,
        Fight to be free,
        The Palestinian sun will shine again,
        From desert to mountain,
        From river to sea.<br><br>
