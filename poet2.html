        <p>
        On a late, peaceful Sunday night,
        We were holding each other so near,
        And by the onset of moonlight,
        You are no longer here.<br><br>

        I don't sleep until morning dawns,
        Staying up late I think of you,
        Knowing to you I'd never do wrong,
        That I'll always be true to you...<br><br>

        Will you always remember me,
        If we don't meet again too soon?
        Will you think day and night, every hour that passes, will you think of me..?<br><br>

        Because you don't abandon my thoughts,
        I remember and don't let your memory fade,
        Yes, you are the only one I need and got,<br><br>
        With you I feel no hate.

        Thinking of when I first met you,
        So far back and so far away,
        I knew that my life wasn't yet through,
        There was no better day.<br><br>

        Whether you're here or not with me,
        My life's turned itself upside down,
        I have never yet felt as free,
        As when you're around.<br><br>

        Will you always remember me,
        If we don't meet again too soon?
        Will you think day and night, every hour that passes, will you think of me..?<br><br>

        Because you don't abandon my thoughts,
        I remember and don't let your memory fade,
        Yes, you are the only one I need and got,
        With you I feel no hate.<br><br>

        On a late, peaceful Sunday night,
        We were holding each other so near,
        And by the onset of moonlight,
        You are no longer here.<br><br>

        I don't sleep until morning dawns,
        Staying up late I think of you,
        Knowing to you I'd never do wrong,
        That I'll always be true to you...<br><br>
