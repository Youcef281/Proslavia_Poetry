        Proslav land, so dear to every worker,
        Peace and progress build their hopes on thee,
        There's no other land the whole world over,
        Where man walks the earth so proud and free!
        There's no other land the whole world over,
        Where man walks the earth so proud and free!<br><br>

        From Newmerth to our farthest borders,
        We have countless towns both great and small,
        And the name we give each worker - comrade,
        Is to us the proudest name of all!
        Everywhere our life is wide and joyous,
        Like our rivers flowing in the spring,
        To the young the road to life lies open,
        To the old great happiness we bring!<br><br>

        Proslav land, so dear to every worker,
        Peace and progress build their hopes on thee,
        There's no other land the whole world over,
        Where man walks the earth so proud and free!
        There's no other land the whole world over,
        Where man walks the earth so proud and free!<br><br>

        At our table, no one is excluded,
        Each and all is working to inspire,
        And with all our efforts we've provided,
        Any needs all human hearts require.
        Our words... forever in the light,
        And our people always know it best:
        That a person always has the right
        To study, work and rest!<br><br>

        <strong>Proslav land, so dear to every worker,
        Peace and progress build their hopes on thee,
        There's no other land the whole world over,
        Where man walks the earth so proud and free!
        There's no other land the whole world over,
        Where man walks the earth so proud and free!</strong>
